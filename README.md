# Reinforcement-Learning
# Domain –Logistics , focus –Optimal path


- Business challenge/requirementBluEx is a leading logistics company in India.  It's known for efficient delivery of packets to customers.  However BluEx is facing a challenge where its vandrivers are taking a suboptimal path for delivery.  This is causing delays and higher fuel cost.

- You as ML expert have to create a ML model using Reinforcement Learning so that efficient path is found through the program.

# Key issues
 - Data has lotsof attributes and classification could be tricky 
 
 # Considerations 
 - Reinforcement Learning is tricky,so the expectation is to come up with sample flow and full-fledged implementation will be done by team later
 
 #Data volume
 -None. Sample data is hard coded in the program
 Additional information
 -NA
 Business benefits
 Up to 15% fuelcost can be saved by taking optimal path
